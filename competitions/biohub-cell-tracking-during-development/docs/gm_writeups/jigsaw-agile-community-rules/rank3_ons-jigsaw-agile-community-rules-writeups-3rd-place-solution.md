# 3rd Place Solution

First of all, I’d like to express my gratitude to Kaggle and Jigsaw ACRC for organizing and hosting this fascinating competition.

I made public my top submission: [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/socom20/t73t74-ens-7b-9b-unsloth-qwen14bx4-qwen8bx1-qwen7).

# This solution is based on these ideas

- Since many rules were hidden, I relied on Test-Time Training (TTT) to fit models during inference time.
- I built a strong ensemble of models that can outperform every single model and can withstand the score variations between the public and private leaderboards.
- All the models and the final ensemble were validated against the Public LB.
- I fitted as many models as possible during the 12-hour inference window.
- The final ensemble was composed of 2 sub-ensembles:
1. *slow ensemble*: composed of LLMs: 2x`Qwen2.5-instruct-14b`, 2x`Qwen2.5-instruct-7b`, 2x`Qwen3-instruct-14b` and 2x`Qwen3-instruct-8b`.
2. *fast ensemble*: composed of faster models: 2x`bge-base-v1.5`, `Qwen3-embedding-0.6b` and `DeBERTa-v3-small`.

# Training Methods

- To perform the pretraining and the TTT a new dataset was built using all the rules, bodies/examples and their corresponding known target.
- The column `subreddit` was discarded. It proved to be unhelpful during both the pretraining and TTT phases.
- The pretraining phase was carried out using this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/socom20/jigsaw-pretraining-v82?scriptVersionId=271410187).

## Slow ensemble
- The LLMs were pretrained during 1 epoch of training using the public dataset.
- The LLMs pretraining was done in a zero-shot fashion, using the following prompt:
 - System prompt: `"You are given a comment on reddit. Your task is to classify if it violates the given rule. Only respond Yes or No.\nRule: {rule_str}"`
 - User prompt: `“1. ```{example_body_str}```\nViolation:{answer_str}”`
- The outputs of the pretraining phase were LoRA weights. These weights were used later to set the starting point of the TTT phase. This approach helped the models to achieve a better performance during TTT since all the LoRAs already knew the competition’s task and the prompt used. 
- I used Unsloth lib to train the LLMs during pretraining and TTT. Unsloth gave me the opportunity to place one model per GPU (T4) and to perform training in parallel.
- Inference was performed using vLLM, and the outputs consisted of the embeddings of the last token.
- To fit all the models within the 12-hour inference window, I merged the weights of the two LoRAs for `Qwen2.5-instruct-7b` and ran inference as a single model. The same approach was applied to the two `Qwen3-instruct-7b` models.
- During TTT, I used the final LoRAs to perform inference on both the training and test datasets. The outputs were the embeddings of the final "Violation:" token.
- These embeddings were used to fit a cross-validated batch of classic machine learning (ML) models (`LightGBM`, `XGBoost` and `SVC`). The idea behind this was to use the training dataset (used during TTT) to train these ML models to output a probability that could be ensembled with the corresponding probabilities from the other models.

## Fast ensemble

- All the models in the fast ensemble didn’t have a pretraining phase and they were only trained during TTT.

### bge-base-en-v1.5:

- `bge-base-en-v1.5` model was trained using Triplet Loss as suggested in the public [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/datafan07/jigsaw-speed-run-10-min-triplet-and-faiss).
- I trained two versions of this model: one using the rules as given (*NormalRules*) and the other with the rules flipped (*FlippedRules*) (for example, instead of saying “do not give legal advice,” I negated the rule to “give legal advice”).
 - *NormalRules* version: the positive sample in the triplet loss was an example with no rule violation, the negative sample was an example with rule violation, and the anchor was the rule.
 - *FlippedRules* version: the examples were inverted: the positive sample in the triplet loss was an example with rule violation, the negative sample was an example with no rule violation, and the anchor was the inverted rule.
- After the training, the final model was used to produce embedding for all the examples and the bodies in the dataset. I calculated the positive and negative centroid embeddings and compose the final embedding as:
`final_embedding = concat([body_embeddings - positive_examples_centroid_embedding, body_embeddings - negative_examples_centroid_embedding])`
- Using these embeddings a new set of ML models was fitted to predict rule violations. The final predictions were used to feed the fast ensemble.

### Qwen3 embedding 0.6b

- I trained a LoRA to predict rule violation using ArcFace loss, the output classes were only two: `rule_violation`, `no_rule_violation` (I also tried other configurations with more classes, for instance, one class per rule, but these didn’t work well in my tests).
- As input for this model I used only the body (I also trained to use `'{rule}: {body}'` as input,  but it didn’t improve the score).
- I used mean pooling to extract embeddings from all bodies and examples in both the training and test datasets.
- Using these embeddings, a new set of ML models was trained to predict rule violations for each rule. The resulting predictions were then used as input for the fast ensemble.

### DeBERTa v3 small

- To train the DeBERTa v3 small model I used cross entropy loss and extracted embeddings from the first token (`[CLS]` token).
- As input for this model I used `'{rule}[SEP]{body}'`.
- Using these embeddings a new set of ML models was fitted to predict rule violations. 
- The probabilities obtained from the ML model were averaged with the output probabilities of the DeBERTa model. The final predictions were used to feed the fast ensemble.
