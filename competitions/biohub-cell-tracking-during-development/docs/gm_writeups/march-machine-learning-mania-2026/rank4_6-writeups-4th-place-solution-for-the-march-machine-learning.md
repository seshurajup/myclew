# 4th Place Solution for the March Machine Learning Mania 2026 Competition

Hi everyone, and thanks to Kaggle for organizing this competition.

This is our official **Solution Write-Up** for the winning submission. Our final solution was a feature-engineered tabular ensemble built on top of **XGBoost + LightGBM**, trained on **symmetrized tournament matchups** with **season-based GroupKFold validation**.

**Code repository:** [https://github.com/Xroxa/4th-Place-Solution-for-the-March-Machine-Learning-Mania-2026-Competition]

The repository contains the full training pipeline, dependency versions, and exact commands to reproduce the final submission.

## Context

**Business context:** [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2026/overview]

**Data context:** [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2026/data]

## Overview of the Approach

Our final approach was a relatively simple but strong tabular pipeline:

1. Build team-level regular season summaries from the **Detailed Results** files.
2. Add strength/context features such as **seed**, **Elo**, **conference strength**, **late-season momentum**, and **Massey ordinals**.
3. Convert tournament games into **pairwise team-vs-team training rows**.
4. Use **symmetric augmentation**:

   * `(TeamA, TeamB) -> y = 1`
   * `(TeamB, TeamA) -> y = 0`
5. Train two gradient-boosted tree models:

   * **XGBoost**
   * **LightGBM**
6. Blend the two models:

   * `0.65 * XGBoost + 0.35 * LightGBM`
7. Clip final probabilities to:

   * `[0.025, 0.975]`

The final code path used a **unified men’s + women’s pipeline**, with the same feature definitions wherever possible.

### Data used

We used the following files from the competition dataset:

**Men**

* `MRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv`
* `MNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv`
* `MNCAATourneySeeds.csv`
* `MTeamConferences.csv`
* `MMasseyOrdinals.csv`

**Women**

* `WRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv`
* `WNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv`
* `WNCAATourneySeeds.csv`
* `WTeamConferences.csv`

**Submission**

* `SampleSubmissionStage2.csv`

We used the **Detailed Results** files rather than the compact versions because they enable possession-based and efficiency-based feature engineering.

### Feature engineering

For each season and team, we built regular-season aggregates from game-level statistics.

#### 1. Basic team summaries

We started from game-level quantities such as:

* `PointDiff = WScore - LScore`
* `TotalPoints = WScore + LScore`

Then we aggregated team-level season features such as:

* `AvgScore`
* `AvgDiff`
* `AvgScoreAllowed`
* `FGM`
* `FGM3`
* `FTA`
* `TO`
* `WinRate`

#### 2. Possession and efficiency features

We estimated possessions as:

```python
df['W_Poss'] = df['WFGA'] - df['WOR'] + df['WTO'] + 0.44 * df['WFTA']
df['L_Poss'] = df['LFGA'] - df['LOR'] + df['LTO'] + 0.44 * df['LFTA']
```

Then offensive efficiency:

```python
df['W_OE'] = 100 * df['WScore'] / df['W_Poss'].clip(1)
df['L_OE'] = 100 * df['LScore'] / df['L_Poss'].clip(1)
```

At the team-season level we aggregated:

* `AvgOE`
* `AvgDE`
* `NetRating = AvgOE - AvgDE`

#### 3. Shooting efficiency and rebounding

We also added:

```python
df['W_TS'] = df['WScore'] / (2 * (df['WFGA'] + 0.44 * df['WFTA'])).clip(1)
df['L_TS'] = df['LScore'] / (2 * (df['LFGA'] + 0.44 * df['LFTA'])).clip(1)

total_reb = (df['WDR'] + df['WOR'] + df['LDR'] + df['LOR']).clip(1)
df['W_RebRate'] = (df['WDR'] + df['WOR']) / total_reb
df['L_RebRate'] = 1 - df['W_RebRate']
```

These were aggregated into:

* `AvgTS_combined`
* `AvgRebRate_combined`

#### 4. Seed feature

We extracted the numeric part of tournament seeds and used:

* missing seed -> `20`

#### 5. Elo rating

We computed end-of-regular-season Elo ratings with:

* `K = 20`
* `home_adv = 100`
* `init_elo = 1500`

Games were processed in chronological order within each season, and ratings carried over between seasons with shrinkage:

```python
current_elo = {
    tid: init_elo + 0.75 * (elo - init_elo)
    for tid, elo in current_elo.items()
}
```

Margin of victory scaled the update:

```python
k_adj = K * np.log1p(abs(row['WScore'] - row['LScore'])) / 2
```

#### 6. Conference strength and late-season momentum

We added two contextual features:

* `Conf_Avg_Elo`: mean Elo of a team’s conference in that season
* `LateWinRate`: win rate in games with `DayNum > 100`

These were intended to capture schedule context and form entering tournament time.

#### 7. Massey ordinals

For men’s teams we used `MMasseyOrdinals.csv` and kept only the final 30 days of rankings before tournament time. We aggregated:

* `OrdinalRank_mean`
* `OrdinalRank_min`
* `OrdinalRank_std`

For women’s teams, where the same Massey file was not used, we filled aligned neutral defaults:

* `OrdinalRank_mean = 175`
* `OrdinalRank_min = 175`
* `OrdinalRank_std = 0`

### Pairwise dataset construction

Tournament games were transformed into team-vs-team rows by merging team-season features for both sides and then taking differences:

```python
feature_cols = [
    'AvgScore', 'AvgDiff', 'FGM', 'FGM3', 'FTA', 'TO',
    'AvgScoreAllowed', 'WinRate', 'Seed',
    'AvgOE', 'AvgDE', 'NetRating',
    'AvgTS_combined', 'AvgRebRate_combined',
    'Elo', 'Conf_Avg_Elo', 'LateWinRate',
    'OrdinalRank_mean', 'OrdinalRank_min', 'OrdinalRank_std'
]

for col in feature_cols:
    df[col] = df[f'{col}_1'] - df[f'{col}_2']
```

We also included two interaction features:

```python
df['elo_ratio'] = df['Elo_1'] / df['Elo_2'].clip(1)
df['seed_product'] = df['Seed_1'] * df['Seed_2']
```

### Symmetric augmentation

To remove directional bias, every tournament game was duplicated in reverse order:

```python
X_rev = X.copy()
for col in feature_cols:
    X_rev[col] = -X_rev[col]
X_rev['elo_ratio'] = 1 / X_rev['elo_ratio'].clip(0.01)
```

Labels were:

* original row -> `1`
* reversed row -> `0`

This was one of the most important design choices in the whole solution.

### Validation strategy

We validated with:

* `GroupKFold(n_splits=5)`

using:

* `groups = Season`

This means the validation splits were done by **season**, not by randomly mixing tournament games. For this competition, season-based validation was much more realistic and helped avoid overly optimistic feedback.

### Models

Our final ensemble had two components.

#### XGBoost

```python
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=4000,
    max_depth=5,
    learning_rate=0.02,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    min_child_weight=3,
    reg_alpha=0.5,
    reg_lambda=1.5,
    eval_metric='logloss',
    tree_method='hist',
    random_state=42,
    verbosity=0,
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
)
```

#### LightGBM

```python
lgbm_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(
    n_estimators=4000,
    learning_rate=0.02,
    num_leaves=63,
    min_child_samples=20,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    reg_alpha=0.5,
    reg_lambda=1.5,
    random_state=42,
    verbosity=-1,
)
```

#### Ensemble

Validation and test predictions were blended as:

```python
preds = 0.65 * preds_xgb + 0.35 * preds_lgb
```

## Details of the Submission

### What was important

The biggest contributors were:

* using **Detailed Results** instead of only compact results
* building **team-season efficiency features**
* adding **Elo**, **conference strength**, and **late momentum**
* using **Massey-based ranking features** for the men’s side
* constructing **pairwise difference features**
* enforcing **symmetry**
* validating by **season**
* using a simple, stable **XGBoost + LightGBM** blend

This was not a deep learning solution. In this competition, careful tabular feature engineering and a clean validation setup worked extremely well.

### What was special about the submission

The most useful non-obvious choices were:

**1. Unified men + women training framework**
Instead of treating the two brackets completely separately, we used the same overall feature template and training logic for both sides, which simplified the pipeline and made the ensemble more consistent.

**2. Symmetric training rows**
This made the prediction target much cleaner. The model learned matchup strength rather than accidentally depending on ordering conventions.

**3. Context features on top of box score features**
Raw team statistics were already good, but adding context through seeds, Elo, conference average Elo, and end-of-season form improved stability.

**4. Conservative probability clipping**
The final predictions were clipped:

```python
sample['Pred'] = np.clip(final_preds, 0.025, 0.975)
```

This reduced extreme probabilities and helped log loss robustness.

### What did not work

A few directions were less useful than expected:

* relying only on raw scoring features without possession-based normalization
* using a single model instead of the final two-model blend
* skipping symmetric augmentation
* depending only on seeds and simple win rate without richer team-strength features

In general, more complicated ideas were not necessary here. The final gains came more from data representation and validation discipline than from model complexity.

### Final training and inference

After cross-validation, both models were retrained on the full symmetrized training set. For inference:

1. Parse `SampleSubmissionStage2.csv` IDs into `Season`, `Team1`, `Team2`
2. Merge team-season features for both teams
3. Recreate the same pairwise difference features
4. Predict with XGBoost and LightGBM
5. Blend:

   * `0.65 * XGB + 0.35 * LGBM`
6. Clip predictions to `[0.025, 0.975]`
7. Save `submission.csv`

Inference code looked like this:

```python
preds_xgb = xgb_final.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
preds_lgb = lgbm_final.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
final_preds = 0.65 * preds_xgb + 0.35 * preds_lgb
sample['Pred'] = np.clip(final_preds, 0.025, 0.975)
sample.to_csv('./submission.csv', index=False)
```

### Reproducibility

* instructions for generating `submission.csv`

Thanks again to Kaggle and to everyone who participated. This was a very fun competition, and I hope this write-up is useful for anyone trying to reproduce or extend the solution.
