# 5th Place Solution

First, let me thank the Vesuvius Challenge team and Kaggle for organizing this fascinating competition. 

## TLDR

My solution is an ensemble of UNets mainy based on a custom SEResNeXt152 encoder with an Attention UNet decoder. All models are trained to regress a signed distance field (SDF) rather than a binary mask. I am using a novel(?) SDF L1 + SDF mass loss which is the sdf equivalent of BCE + Dice. SDF predictions are averaged across checkpoints and up to 8 TTA flips. At the end all is binarized at an SDF threshold of 0.3, and then refined with an iterative persistence-homology-based tunnel-filling post-processing pipeline. Although training on 160x160x160 crops, I inferred on full 320x320x320 to prevent any artifacts from a sliding window approach. 

## Cross-Validation

I used 4-fold cross-validation. During training I tracked three metrics locally - Surface Dice, VOI accelerated by GPU on original size, and the topology score on 10x downsampled size on CPU as the bettimatching algorithm is sequential. Neither local CV nor public LB correlated well with private LB, hence my selection of final submission went poorly. 

## Training Routine

All models are trained on 160^3 ROI patches randomly cropped from the npy saved 320^3 training volumes. SDF targets are calculated on the fly. Training uses the Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-3, cosine annealing schedule. Mixed-precision training with bfloat16 is used throughout, and gradient checkpointing is enabled for the larger SEResNeXt152 models to fit within GPU memory. Weight clamping to the fp16-safe range is applied at checkpointing time to ensure clean float16 inference later. Batch size is 16.

Data augmentation consists of random 3D flips along each spatial axis (p=0.5 each) and random 90-degree rotations in the (axis-1, axis-2) plane (p=0.5). CutMix (beta=1.0) was used in earlier model families but disabled for the final SEResNeXt152 runs, where it did not improve scores.

## Loss Function: SDF L1 and "mass"

The key design decision was to train models to regress a signed distance field rather than a binary segmentation mask. The SDF target is computed from the binary label via Euclidean distance transforms on the fly on GPU:

```
fg_edt = distance_transform_edt(foreground_mask)
bg_edt = distance_transform_edt(~foreground_mask)
sdf = bg_edt - fg_edt          # negative inside, positive outside, zero at boundary
sdf = clamp(sdf, -100, 5)
```

The loss has two components with equal weight:

**Weighted SDF L1 loss (weight 0.5)**: A voxel-wise L1 loss between predicted and target SDF, weighted by a Gaussian bell-curve matrix that concentrates supervision near the surface boundary:

```
W(sdf) = 1 + w0 * exp(-((sdf + core_radius)^2) / (2 * sigma^2))
```

with `w0 = 8`, `sigma = 4`, `core_radius = 5`. This gives a peak weight of 9.0 at `sdf = -5` (inside the surface at depth 5 voxels), plateauing at 9.0 for deeper interior, and decaying to ~1.0 far from the surface. The effect is that the model receives a strong gradient signal near the surface while distant background voxels contribute minimally.

**SDF-based Dice loss (weight 0.5)**: Instead of thresholding to binary, a continuous "mass" is derived via `ReLU(-sdf)` for both prediction and target, and a soft Dice coefficient is computed from these masses. This provides a global volumetric overlap signal that complements the voxel-wise L1.

The following figure illustrates the three quantities at a central slice (axis_0 = 160) of a training volume:

*Left: original binary target (0 = background, 1 = foreground, 2 = ignore). Center: SDF target (negative inside surface, positive outside; black contour at SDF = 0). Right: Gaussian weight matrix (higher weights near and inside the surface boundary).*

This loss combined with gaussian weighting solves a lot of the key challenges of this competition in an elegant and efficient way: Sheet separation, sheet continuity, boundary sharpness, precise skeletons etc. 

## Model Architectures

I explored a wide range of 3D architectures. Instead of relying on frameworks like nnUnet or medicai I asked an agent to recode relevant model families from scratch. This gives much more control. For the keras based SEResnext model from medcai it was also 60% (!) faster for training. The final ensemble draws from three architecture lineages:

**SEResNeXt152 + Attention UNet** -- the main workhorse and strongest single model. A custom pure-PyTorch 3D SE-ResNeXt152 encoder (layers `[3, 8, 36, 3]`, groups=32, width_per_group=8, SE reduction=16, DropPath rate 0.3) paired with an Attention UNet decoder (channels `[256, 128, 64, 32, 16]`). Attention gates on skip connections let the decoder focus on relevant encoder features. Gradient checkpointing is essential here due to the 36-block third stage. One variant using `seresnext152_48x8d` (48 groups, width 8) for additional capacity.

**ResNet152 + skip maxpool** -- Expensive UNet with a ResNet152 encoder, custom decoder channel configuration, and deep supervision during training (auxiliary losses at intermediate decoder stages). I skip one early maxpool so resolution through the model is higher. At inference, only the final head is used.

**ResNet152 + UNet with SDF loss heavy augs and external data** -- earlier ResNet152-based UNets trained with the SDF + Dice loss. One model extends the training set with additional scrolls. I used an additional binary input channel to give the model pixelwise information that this data is external (and hence labels are "bad") These models provide useful diversity to the ensemble despite being individually weaker than SEResNeXt152. 

I also experimented with SwinUNETR, UNETR++, MedNeXt, SegFormer3D, ConvNeXt V2, U-Mamba, and SEResNeXt200, but none surpassed the SEResNeXt152 + AttUNet architecture on local validation. Some topology-aware loss variants (persistence diagram matching loss, Euler characteristic loss) were explored. One PD-matching variant is included in the final ensemble but its finetuned only for a few epochs from another model because training was very slow.

## Ensemble

Predictions are combined by simple averaging of raw SDF logits across all checkpoints and TTA augmentations per sample. For the larger SEResNeXt152 models, TTA is reduced to 2 augmentations (identity + triple-flip) to stay within the 9-hour Kaggle kernel runtime; smaller models use the full 8-flip TTA (3 single-axis flips + 3 dual-axis + 1 triple-axis + identity).

NaN safety is critical: the SEResNeXt152 models are trained in bfloat16 but inference runs in float16. A safety conversion routine clamps all weights to `[-65504, 65504]` and registers forward hooks that replace any NaN/Inf activations.

## Inference

All inference is done on full 320x320x320 image! No strided slices, as those create artifacts that are very harmful to topology.
Two GPUs are used in parallel via data sharding: even-indexed test samples go to GPU 0, odd-indexed to GPU 1. Each GPU processes all models sequentially for its shard and offload predictions to disk to prevent OOM. 

## Post-Processing

Post-processing proved essential for the topology score, which heavily penalizes tunnels (H1 topological features) in the predicted surface. My pipeline:

**Step 1 -- Binarization**: Threshold the averaged SDF logits at 0.3 (voxels with SDF < 0.3 become foreground).

**Step 2 -- Dust removal**: Remove small connected components (< 50,000 voxels, 6-connectivity), preserving components that touch at least 3 volume boundaries regardless of size.

**Step 3 -- Iterative H1 tunnel filling** (13 iterations):

1. **SDF filtration**: Overwrite foreground voxels in the raw SDF to `threshold - 1.0`, creating a cubical filtration where the surface sits at the threshold.
2. **Persistence barcode computation**: Split the volume into 2x2x2 = 8 octant tiles, compute persistence homology on each tile using a custom C++ module (`barcode3d_fast_v3`) which was derived from betti matching library. This identifies H1 features (tunnels) with birth/death values and coordinates.
3. **Straddling filter**: Keep only H1 features where `birth < sdf_threshold < death`, i.e., tunnels that cross the binarization surface.
4. **Adaptive radius**: For each tunnel's death coordinate, estimate the tunnel width from the background EDT and set the fill radius to `clip(edt_width + 1.0, 3.5, 7.0)`.
5. **Bridge detection**: Simulate filling a ball at each death coordinate and check whether it would merge separate connected components. Skip coordinates that would create bridges.
6. **Ball filling**: Fill spherical balls at the remaining death coordinates. On the final iteration, also apply morphological hole filling.
7. **Component count guard**: If filling reduced the number of connected components (accidental merge), revert to the pre-fill state.

## Key Insights

- **SDF regression > binary classification** for this metric suite. The SDF naturally encodes distance-to-surface information, and thresholding the SDF at different values during validation gives a smooth trade-off between Surface Dice and topology metrics. Binary cross-entropy models consistently scored lower on the topology component.
- **Gaussian weighting** focuses the loss on the skeleton region, but still extents to sheet boundary. Background is heavily downweighted. 
- **Iterative tunnel filling** with bridge detection is the single most impactful post-processing step. Going from 0 to 13 iterations improved the topology score by ~0.08 on local validation, with diminishing returns beyond 11-13 iterations.
