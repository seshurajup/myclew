# MAP2025_Private&Public 2nd 

Thanks so much for the host and I am very delighted to join the competition. My teammate Baiph was very hard working and we did the same contribution to the final results, both of us have the different training pipeline in that way we can be 2nd in public and private leaderboard.

P.S.  I am looking for a remote job in NLP or LLM area, perefered UTC +8 time zone, please email me if it's possible.

# Overview of our solution
The task of this competation is to predict the misunderstandings according to the student's explaination. This is a very easy classification problem but the metric of this comptation is MAP@3 which is used in Ranking Problem normally, so I think the label is ambiguous sometimes, the student's explainations can be labeled in more than one target.

Based on above analysis, what we need to do is denoise or give the student's explaination some soft labels according to oof in case of label leakage.

As for data, there are over 30 labels had limited data, so I used many commerical LLM to generate external data.

As for model selection, we used LLM model as the backbone we tried qwne3, qwen2.5, mistral, phi-4.

As for training strategy, we all convert the classification problem as the multi-choices generation problem, only in this way, we can use vllm to finish the inference timely.

## HZM Part
I am here to introduce my best private sigle model qwen3 -14b which can be much more easy to understand.
The training pipeline can be divided into 4 steps.

### Step1: Generate the ext data (both I and Baiph used them)
Generate one student output with a rare candidate for each question.
Incorporate contrastive learning with the labels.

```python
For example:
if I want to generate student's explation which is True_Misconception:Additive(use this as hard label in step4 training), 
I will use 
False_Misconception:Additive_same_math_problem and False_Misconception:Additive_different_math_problem
+
True_Misconception:Additive_same_math_problem and True_Misconception:Additive_different_math_problem
put the contrastive examples let the ChatGPT or Claude generate better data
```

I used gpt-4, gpt-5, claude-sonnet, gemini, seed, doubao, and generated 80K data.

### Step2: Train LLM to label ext data
Train 4 LLM models on all train.csv and then label ext data (use this as soft label in step4 training), which were phi_4_reasoning_14b,qwen3_32b,mistral_12b,qwen2_5_72b
```python
The following is training prompt:
        """Analyze the student's answer and explanation.            
        Determine if the student's answer is correct (True) or incorrect (False)
        Evaluate if the explanation shows correct reasoning, contains a misconception, or is neither
        If a misconception is present, identify the specific type
        Select exactly ONE label from the 65 options below \n"""
    "{0}"
    "Your Answer: [Select one letter option from A through BM]\n"
    "Input is :\n"
    "Question: {1}\n"
    "Option: {2}\n"
    "Correct Answer: {3}\n"
    "Student Answer: {4}\n"
    "Student Explanation: {5}\n"
```

### Step3: Train LLM in 5 fold to generate soft label
Train 4 LLM models in 5 fold, avg the oof.csv (use this as soft label in step4 training)

### Step4: Multi-loss desgin for qwen3-14b
I changed the SFTTrainer and combined the generation loss (hard label) and classification loss (soft label)
target_token_id meant that the each option will convert to a token id in vocab.

```python
class SFTChoiceTrainer(SFTTrainer):
    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False, num_items_in_batch=None, return_choice_logit=False):

        target_token_id = self.model.config.target_token_id
        target_token_id = torch.tensor(target_token_id, device=model.device)

        labels = inputs['labels']
        mask = torch.isin(labels, target_token_id)
        labels[~mask] = -100
        inputs['labels'] = labels
        _, outputs = super().compute_loss(model, inputs, return_outputs=True, num_items_in_batch=num_items_in_batch)
        logits = outputs.logits
        loss = outputs.loss
        #print(outputs)
        shift_logits = logits[..., :-1, :].contiguous()
        shift_labels = labels[..., 1:].contiguous()

        logits_target = []
        for i in range(len(shift_labels)):
            lbl = shift_labels[i].cpu().numpy()
            target_idx = np.where(lbl != -100)[0][-1]
            logits_target.append(shift_logits[i][target_idx][target_token_id])
        #
        # # (batch_size, 26)
        logits_target = torch.stack(logits_target, dim=0)
        # # (batch_size)
        labels_target = inputs['soft_label'].to(outputs.logits.device)
        soft_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_target, labels_target)

        #weight = self._soft_weight()
        loss = loss +  soft_loss
        return (loss, outputs) if return_outputs else loss
```

After the above steps the CV on fold-0 can achieve** 0.955** and public is **0.950** private is **0.946**
