# First Loser (aka 4th place)

Thanks to Kaggle and all for a great Playground competition. I am fairly new to Kaggling and what I had fun in this competition was finally one where the CV/LB correlation was decent (when you knew what to look for), and there was enough signal to work with. I would also like to thank everyone who shared their insights and code!

## FE

I used a combination of features across my models - there was a lot of signal here to gain from FE:

**Base feature transformations:**
- Interaction features: `study_hours × class_attendance`, `study_hours × sleep_hours`
- Ratio features: `study_hours / (sleep_hours + eps)`
- Polynomial features: `study_hours²`, `class_attendance²`

**Categorical encodings:**
- Target encoding with 5-fold CV scheme (smoothing parameter: 10.0)
- Mean/std of study_hours per categorical group
- Ordinal mapping of categorical features

**GroupBy statistics:**
- Mean/std/count of exam_score by category
- Study hours z-score within category

**Composite features:**
- `good_indicators` = count of positive indicators (good sleep + high facility + internet + coaching)
- `study_effort` = study_hours × (class_attendance / 100)
- `sleep_deficit` = |sleep_hours - 8.0|

**Formula-based features:**
- Reverse-engineered linear formula: `5.86 × study_hours + 0.32 × class_attendance + 1.39 × sleep_hours + categorical_bonuses`

I also tried other fancier techniques like getting embeddings from NN, etc. but they didn't add enough signal to make it worth it.

## Models

I focused on building a large diverse model pool rather than perfecting individual models. Here are my main model types and their CV scores:

| Model type | CV | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| TabM | 8.589 | Best single model, multi-seed averaged |
| XGBoost | 8.600 | Classification auxiliary variant helped |
| LightGBM | 8.621 | DART and Huber loss variants |
| CatBoost | 8.697 | Didn't spend much time on this one |
| MLP | 8.625 | Various architectures [512,256,128] |
| ResNet | 8.630 | Skip connections helped slightly |
| FTTransformer | 8.640 | High correlation with tree models |
| TabPFN | 8.650 | Added some algorithm diversity |
| KNN (Manhattan) | 8.720 | Low correlation (0.916) but weak |

Some other models I tried: xLearn FFM, RealMLP, LNN, DeepFM, quantile regression variants, etc.

**Key finding on diversity:** Models with high correlation (> 0.99) improved CV but actually WORSENED LB.

## Ensembling

My final ensemble has a total of **330 models** ensembled with Ridge (α=1.0): **CV 8.5659, LB 8.53642**.

I tried other meta-learners:
- BayesianRidge: +0.002 worse than Ridge
- NNLS (non-negative least squares): +0.041 worse
- CatBoost stacker: worse than Ridge
- Simple averaging: much worse

**Ridge worked best:** Negative weights are essential! Ridge allows de-correlating redundant models by assigning negative weights, which NNLS cannot do.

## What Didn't Work

I spent a lot of time on things that didn't create meaningful diversity:
- Target transformations (log, logit) - GBDTs learn the same patterns
- Loss function changes (quantile, Huber) - correlation still > 0.99
- Different hyperparameters - correlation > 0.995
- Different seeds - correlation > 0.998
- Post-processing (isotonic, quantile mapping) - negligible or destructive
- Adding highly correlated models - improved CV, worsened LB

## Post-processing

Just clipping predictions to [19.6, 100] to match the target distribution. Anything fancier (isotonic regression, Platt scaling, quantile mapping) either didn't help or hurt.

## Conclusion

The fundamental challenge with this competition was that CTGAN-generated synthetic data is "too clean" - all models converge to learning the same underlying linear pattern. The key insight for me was recognizing that **more models ≠ better** when those models are highly correlated, and that CV improvements from correlated models don't translate to LB improvements.

But as I have learnt from @mahoganybuttstrings numerous writeups, ensembling many diverse models is the way to go - but "diverse" is the key word. Hoping to get on podium next time!
