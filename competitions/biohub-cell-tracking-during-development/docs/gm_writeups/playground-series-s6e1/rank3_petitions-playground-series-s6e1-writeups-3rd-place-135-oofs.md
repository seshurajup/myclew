# 3rd place - 135 OOFs

Congrats to all the winners and special thanks to all the people who shared insight and notebooks for this competition: @cdeotte, @include4eto, @siukeitin, @mikhailnaumov, @omidbaghchehsaraei, @mahoganybuttstrings, @yekenot.

My solution is pretty much the same as @tilii7's solution: just add as many diverse models to an ensemble. I didn't really bother much with FE (I was kinda too lazy to test anything :P).

#Models

Here are my models:

| Model | CV | Private LB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| XGB | 8.59994 | 8.59171 |
| LGBM | 8.62145 | 8.62143 |
| CatBoost | 8.69769 | 8.66484 |
| TabM | 8.58894 | 8.58800 |
| RealMLP | 8.59069 | 8.58555 |
| LNN | 8.61888 | 8.61536 |

My CatBoost is bad cuz I didn't really work on it as much and it ran way too slow (maybe I set the hyperparameters wrong or something).
