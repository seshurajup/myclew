# 1st Anniversary in Kaggle Competitions
I’m excited to share my solution write-up for this binary classification competition—my approach helped me reach 5th place, and it’s been a tough yet rewarding learning journey from start to finish. March 2026 marks exactly one year in Kaggle Competitions, and as someone from a non-scientific/mathematical discipline, grasping the concepts behind different architectures and algorithms has been a steep curve. I genuinely owe a lot to the great teachers and participants who openly share their knowledge and solutions with the public. Appreciation goes to @cdeotte @tilii7 @siukeitin @optimistix @ravi20076 @mahoganybuttstrings @masayakawamata @mikhailnaumov @yekenot @include4eto, and last but not least @mpwolke for the thoughtful preliminary insights at the start of every competition. 

I appreciate you and everyone who shared valuable knowledge with the community.

## Hillclimb, Ridge, BayesianRidge, Optimized Blend
| Model | Score | LB | PB |
| --- | --- |
| BayesianRidge | 0.91983 | 0.91733 | 0.91846 🏆 | 
| Ridge | 0.91986 | 0.91730 | 0.91845 | 
| Hillclimb  | 0.91989 | 0.91730 | 0.91840 | 
| Optimized Blend (3 above) | 0.91989 | 0.91732 | 0.91842 | 

## Sumission
Unfortunately, I ended up submitting `Ridge` and `Optimized Blend` rather than selecting the single most promising personal-score configuration; the submission ultimately landed at `0.91845` with `Ridge`, while `BayesianRidge` had the best result at `0.91846`.
