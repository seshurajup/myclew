# 9th place solution

Firstly, a big thank you to the organizers and the community. My final ensemble was a blend of Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Linear Models. I used two different feature sets for all the models and blended the predictions in the final.

**Final CV Score: 0.919911**

# Feature Engineering

For feature engineering, I relied on proven community techniques and public insights [from here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/blamerx/s6e3-ridge-xgb-n-gram-0-91927-cv), and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yekenot/ps-s6-e3-realmlp-pytabkit), which provided a robust baseline for my models.

# Models

To reach the 9th position, I ensemble a massive library of models using the above-mentioned feature engineering techniques. My final solution included:

- GBDT Models: CatBoost (Plain, Ordered), XGBoost (with Pseudo-labeling, Target Encoding, and Residual-based versions), LightGBM (GOSS and TE), and HistGradientBoosting.

- Deep Learning for Tabular Data: A heavy emphasis on specialized architectures, including RealMLP, TabM, TabTransformer, FT-Transformer, ResNet, and TorchFrame.

- Specialized Architectures: I also experimented with and included GNNs, GateNet, DANet, DCNv2, Bartz and xLearn to ensure the ensemble had maximum architectural diversity.

- Refined Variants: Several models, including TabM, RealMLP, DANet, GateNet, DCNv2, and FTT, were trained from scratch with the idea from @yunsuxiaozi to squeeze out marginal gains in CV.

# Validation & Ensemble

- Cross-Validation: I used a strict Stratified K-Fold strategy.
- Ensemble Strategy: I converted all OOF predictions to ranks using scipy.stats.rankdata and used a GPU-accelerated Hill Climbing algorithm.
