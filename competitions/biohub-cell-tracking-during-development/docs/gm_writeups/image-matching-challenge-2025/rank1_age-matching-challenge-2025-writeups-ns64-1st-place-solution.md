# 1st Place Solution

Thank you to the organizers and Kaggle team for this exciting competition. Congratulations to all the participants. Although I first participated in IMC in 2022, I'm glad that this time I achieved my best results ever.

This year, I focused on utilizing recent 3D geometric foundation models such as MASt3R and VGGT. I was surprised at their potential. I respect the authors who developed such great models.

## 1. Overview

I developed a simple MASt3R-based pipeline.

As far as I've tried, image matching using MASt3R's local feature head appears to achieve significantly better results than other detector-based methods such as ALIKED+LG on IMC25.

- Pre-clustering using coarse MASt3R matching on the top-k neighbor images (not shown in the figure).
- Image pair extraction with the combination of multiple shortlists derived from image retrieval.
- Utilizing MASt3R (https://github.com/naver/mast3r) as a matcher. In addition to MASt3R semi-dense matches,
  keypoints extracted by other keypoint detectors are also matched using MASt3R.
- Generating reconstructions using a general COLMAP pipeline (based on https://www.kaggle.com/code/eduardtrulls/imc25-submission)

## 2. Solution

I observed that MASt3R-based matching achieves higher precision (i.e., fewer mismatches) than other methods, so it can match images in messy scenes where detector-based methods typically fail.
I think the following points are probably useful for robust matching:

- 3D geometric features (From DUSt3R)
- MASt3R is trained not only with the MegaDepth dataset but also with several object-centric datasets

By simply using the MASt3R model as a semi-dense detector-free matcher and integrating it into a general COLMAP pipeline, I achieved a score of 42-45 on the PublicLB. Furthermore, I found that increasing the number of image pairs led to a higher score, reaching approximately 50. Therefore, I thought that how image pairs could be increased within limited computational time might be an important consideration.

### 2.1. Clustering

I developed a pre-clustering approach based on MASt3R matches, but this approach was not adopted in the final version. It turned out that, since image matching primarily uses MASt3R, there wasn't a significant difference whether I used pre-clustering or multiple reconstructions from COLMAP.

The pre-clustering (which was not used) approach is outlined below:

1. Initialize the cluster label for each image to -1
2. Extract N images from the scene using farthest point sampling, and assign each of them a unique cluster label (0, 1, ..., N-1).
3. For each of the N seed images (from step 2), run 1-vs-all matching with MASt3R against other unclustered images. If an image is matched, assign the seed image's cluster label to the matched image. Otherwise, assign a new cluster label to it.
4. Use the newly matched images as the next queries, and repeat 1-vs-k matching iteratively until all images are assigned a cluster label
5. Treat small clusters as "outliers"

### 2.2. Shortlist

Since the MASt3R matcher is computationally more intensive than detector-based methods, a shortlist of image pairs for matching is still important.

I generated candidate pairs for matching within a scene by taking the union of neighbors from multiple image retrieval results. I used the following four global features for image retrieval.

- MASt3R-ASMK (From MASt3R-SfM https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19152)
- MASt3R-SPoC (From MASt3R-SfM https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19152)
- DINOv2
- ISC (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04323)

Although MASt3R-ASMK could extract pairs with sufficient coverage, adding the other models slightly improved the score.

| Features    | Parameters                        |
|:------------|:----------------------------------|
| MASt3R-ASMK | n=10, k=25 (See MASt3R-SfM paper) |
| MASt3R-SPoC | topk=10                           |
| DINOv2      | topk=10                           |
| ISC         | topk=10                           |

Note that using only MASt3R-ASMK with heavier settings (e.g., MASt3R-ASMK(n=10, k=60)) can also achieve a high score, but the proposed method is faster while achieving a similar score.

### 2.3. Pairwise matching

First, matches for an image pair are computed by MASt3R. This implementation is based on `fast_reciprocal_NNs()` from the code in the official repository. I used default parameters of subsample=8 and pixel_tol=5.

In addition to the semi-dense matches, keypoints extracted by other keypoint detectors are also fed to the MASt3R matcher (Inspired by MP-SfM https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20040). These additional keypoints might regionally overlap with points subsampled by MASt3R, but this approach improved the score compared to using only MASt3R matches.

I used ALIKED and SuperPoint as the additional keypoint detectors. While I also tried SIFT, GIMSuperPoint, and DaD, I ultimately adopted the combination of ALIKED and SuperPoint because this combination yielded the best LB score.

The detailed configurations are as follows:

| Model                   | Parameters                                      |
|:------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| MASt3R                  | size=512, threshold=1.001                       |
| ALIKED detector         | size=1280, max_keypoints=4096                   |
| SuperPoint detector     | size=1600, max_keypoints=4096, threshold=0.0005 |

### 2.4. Engineering tips

In addition, I applied the following techniques to make the pipeline faster:

- Build the curope (RoPE2D) module with CUDA.
- Replace attention implementations used in mast3r/dust3r/croco with `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention`.
  (to enable flash attention)
- Fix `use_amp` args in the MASt3R inference function to be used correctly.
- Use the T4 x 2 environment in Kaggle, and run the submission pipeline in parallel over scene subsets, split by dataset in `submission.csv`.

According to Speedy MASt3R (https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10017), TensorRT can further accelerate the MASt3R model. However, I wasn't able to convert the model.

### 2.5. Local/Public/Private Score

|                   | amy_gardens | fbk_vineyard | ETs    | stairs  | Public  | Private  |
|:------------------|:------------|:-------------|:-------|:--------|:--------|:---------|
| Best submission   | 40.65       | 72.09        | 59.46  | 15.89   | 52.64   | 56.00    |
| w/ Pre-clustering | 37.02       | 47.25        | 59.46  | 20.35   | 50.22   | 50.93    |

- The scores of `amy_gardens` and `fbk_vineyard` seemed to be unstable.
- `stairs` was difficult (As a side note, VGGT achieved the highest score of `25.07` in my local experiments)

## 3. What did not work

- GLOMAP: I tried GLOMAP instead of COLMAP with the pre-clustering approach, but it didn't improve the score.
- Coarse-to-Fine matching: Probably, there was a bug in my implementation.
- Using monocular depth estimation: I tried to filter mismatched pairs using depth information.
- VGGT: The tracking head of VGGT with pre-extracted keypoints worked well on local tests, but it resulted in a `TimeoutError` in submission.
