2: Alike + LightGlue applied on pairs obtained from 1.
3: SIFT + Nearest Neighbor matching on pairs from 1.
### Crop Generation and Matching:
4: Generate crops for target object based on the ensemble of matches from 1., 2., and 3.
5: Apply Alike + LightGlue on the crops generated in step 4.
6: Apply Superpoint + LightGlue on the crops from step 4.
### Final Matching and Reconstruction:
7: Concatenate matches from steps 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; then run RANSAC and filter pairs with a minimum of 150 matches.
8: Run COLMAP with default parameters and generate clusters similarly to the public notebook.
