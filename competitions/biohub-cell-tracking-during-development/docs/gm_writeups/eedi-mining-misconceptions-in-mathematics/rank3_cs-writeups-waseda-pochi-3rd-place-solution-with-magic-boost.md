# 3rd Place Solution (with Magic Boost)

First, I want to thank the organizers for hosting this competition, and the Kaggle community for all the discussions and shared notebooks that helped me learn so much.

## My Solution
A two-stage approach:

### Stage 1: Retrieval
- Used Qwen-14B Embedder (from @anhvth226 ) ensemble with Qwen-14B embedder trained with FlagEmbedding
- Retrieved 35 most relevant misconceptions for each question
- Used publicly shared Retriever and tried my own FlagEmbedding-trained Retriever
- To be honest, my self-trained Retriever was pretty bad and removing it actually improved the score (lol)

### Stage 2: Reranking
- Used Qwen-32B-instruct-AWQ reranker
- Ensembled 6 different LoRAs with various training parameters and cross-validation
- One model included about 2000 GPT4-mini generated samples, but the improvement was... not very significant

Scores at this point:
- Public LB: 0.590
- Private LB: 0.564

## Time for Some Magic!
Here comes the most interesting part!

It started when I discovered over 900 unseen misconceptions in the misconceptions table that never appeared in the training data. Plus, according to @zhudong1949 and @eugenkrylov findings (check here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/eedi-mining-misconceptions-in-mathematics/discussion/550875), the testing set had many unseen subjects and only about 685 questions.

So I thought: these unseen misconceptions must make up a significant portion of the testing set!

### Let's Experiment
On the second-to-last day of the competition (yes, I really dared to use two submissions for experiments at this point XD), I did this LB probing:
- Predicted only 1 misconception per question
- Tested twice:
  1. Using only seen misconceptions from training data: got 0.154
  2. Using only unseen misconceptions: got 0.444

Seeing these results, I made a bold guess that the seen-to-unseen ratio in the testing data was roughly 1:3.

### The Final Magic Touch
So I implemented a simple post-processing:
- Multiplied the probabilities of all predicted unseen misconceptions by a constant C
- Adjusted until unseen misconceptions made up 75% of the first predictions

This little magic trick made the scores skyrocket 😮:
- Public LB: 0.590 → 0.658
- Private LB: 0.564 → 0.600

In the final version, I also randomly shuffled the order of misconceptions input to the reranker, which gave a small additional boost:
- Public LB: 0.670
- Private LB: 0.602
