#  Title: 
4th Place Solution for the March Machine Learning Mania 2025 Competition

Data context: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/data

#  Overview of the Approach:
Logistic regression (win or loss) on the leaf nodes of Xgboost with Cauchy loss function on point differential. Features include all features of the original https://www.kaggle.com/code/raddar/vilnius-ncaa but I added Laplace Smoothed features based upon prior season matchup, away wins, last 14 day win ratio, and  uniquely stacked out of fold predictions. For the validation strategy, I only use personal intuition based upon the Brier score of the last year 2024 being left out.

#  Details of the Submission: 
I did not use the CV code listed because of time based leakage. I did not use the spline in the original code because of target leakage. I used the leave one season out only for model averaging instead of CV. I had models with "better" leaky local CV which I did not submit. No gambling was used. No manual manipulation was used. My other submission was Raddar's old Github published solution in R which won multiple times in the past. I did not use any external data and only utilized data published on Kaggle for official use in this competition.

This code should exactly reproduce my submission file except on matches including non-seeded teams. These are all set at 0.5. It would take too much RAM and time to produce a file with all possible matches including non-seeded teams within Kaggle Notebooks.
