# 4th Place Solution — Trainable Traces & a Full-Solve Bit-Manipulation Reasoner

First, a big thank you to **NVIDIA** and **Kaggle** for running this competition.
It was a truly instructive challenge to figure out the quirks of compressing chain of thoughts and making sure it follows the algorithm exactly /make-no-mistakes and I learned a ton.

Thanks also to everyone on the forums who shared ideas and baselines throughout. And a special thanks to @huikang for sharing the open progress prize baseline, just like many others, its a major part of my final model.

## TL;DR

- The main upside was 99.4% of bit-manipulation, as they actually map to only 5 templates.
-  Designing **trainable traces**. I didn't have a whole lot of compute, so my principle was to refine the bit manipulation traces until they have >95% high accuracy with only ~2500 examples (original + generated). Huikang's original traces was close to 82% accurate with the same amount of training.
- I was able to use the trainable traces as guiding principles for an coding assistant LLM to refine the traces without me needing to review them, while not hiding compute or referencing information after already providing the output.
- Smaller wins on the other categories: frequency-ordered operator deduction for `equation_numeric_deduce`, also optimal solve rate for `equation_numeric_guess`, and symbol-splitting + an operator-glyph prior for cryptarithm which reduced errors.
- **LoRA setup changes**: MoE experts untied, lower batch size (12/16) learns better. Fully trained on RTX 6000 Pro, no Tinker api.
- **Compute & data**: I spent only about ~$120 total, on Colab Pro G4 instances + Kaggle weekly compute. Final Training data was 9,500 original problems + 15,000 synthetic traces.

Basically all of the code in this solution was written by Claude (Opus 4.8). I **actively tried to automate every step I was doing manually**, including vague ideas like creating trainable traces to check for hidden compute.

## What makes a trace "trainable"

To achieve high accuracy with low amount of training, when reading a trace, my intuition was "can I figure out in my head where this next token came from?". Effectively it follows the principles of scratchpad traces, but making the Opus follow the principles when iterating traces let me optimize it much better than I could manually.

1. **No hidden compute.** Every emitted token must be derivable from visible
   context plus a small, fixed rule set. If your generator computes something (a
   join, a filter, a best-of-N pick) and prints only the result, thats too much compute to be done in a single forward pass.
2. **Locality.** Computation must sit near its operands. Retrieving a short
   named value from far away is fine; computing over operands printed thousands
   of tokens earlier reliably fails, especially for smaller models. Rule of thumb:
   every line should be computable from ~10–20 lines above it, or be a verbatim
   copy of a named line.
3. **Causal consistency.** The shape of the trace may only depend on what's
   already written. If only the winner gets a special verification block, the
   model learns "decide first, decorate later".
4. **Reference integrity.** A deduction line may only cite names/values that
   literally appear earlier in the trace.
5. **Fewer, uniform rules.** Every distinct rule is something the adapter has to learn. A complex set of rules that trigger only on a small percentage of traces won't get learnt reliably. That will end up needing a huge amount examples to fit. A structure that fires in only a handful of traces can't be learned at all.

**N.B** I'm not trying to say complex rules cannot be learnt by the Nemotron model, its a 30B model with enough examples it can likely learn highly complex rules, but I needed to reduce the training samples needed.

### Tests for trainable traces

Because these properties are mechanical, they can be checked with code. Claude wrote scripts that ran as tests on the full trace
dump after every format change:

- a **reference-integrity audit** (every quoted entry exists in its source
  block)
- a **locality audit** (for every derived line, measure the token distance to
  the farthest source line it needs, bucketed by edge type)

### Metrics for correctness

The main metric I observed for training was first token divergence, this can be measured at training time by greedily checking the model's next token against the ground truth. If you use all unique sequences during training, that's effectively an eval on an unseen trace. I also ran cheap non-generation eval the same way, "how many greedy next token probabilty matches the ground truth" (refer to the training code link shared below). In practice I observed that an 80% exactly meant over 95% generation match, because not all mistakes are load bearing, sometimes a wrong token during generation doesn't change the result.

### Pointing the LLM at the generation viewer

I built several throwaway web-ui for the challenge, to help with visualization and understanding. One of them renders the trained
model's generation side-by-side with the gold trace, with the divergences highlighted. Later I pointed Claude directly at this viewer's output, and it would
spot the recurring failure pattern (e.g. "clustered misses on the Matched section")
and propose a format fix that removed the hidden hop. Train → diff → classify → reformat → retrain, each training about ~1 hour.

## Per category solutions

### Fully solved bit manipulation (almost)

Bit-manipulation was the category I invested the most in, and it's where the
trainable-trace philosophy paid off. I discovered that all the problems that
aren't 1op or 2op solvable follow one of 5 templates, built over three shifted
leaves — `SHLa` = shift-left by `a`, `SHRb` = shift-right by `b`, `ROTc` = rotate
by `c`:

| template | form | per-bit definition |
|---|---|---|
| **Majority** | `Majority(SHLa, SHRb, ROTc)` | majority vote of the three leaves |
| **Choice** | `Choice(SHLa, SHRb, ROTc)` | `SHLa ? SHRb : ROTc` |
| **M5** | `Majority(SHRb, SHLa OR ¬ROTc, ROTc OR ¬SHLa)` | `SHRb OR ¬(SHLa XOR ROTc)` |
| **C3** | `Choice(SHLa, ROTc, SHRb OR ¬ROTc)` | `SHLa ? ROTc : (SHRb OR ¬ROTc)` |
| **C4** | `Choice(SHLa, SHRb XOR ROTc, SHRb OR ¬ROTc)` | `SHLa ? (SHRb XOR ROTc) : (SHRb OR ¬ROTc)` |

These solve all the remaining problems, and cruicially in the exact position as the template, for example the Choice templates always start with SHL.

Unfortunately this cannot be solved with brute force search within 7500 tokens, so I still had to design a trace that reduces the search.

The key insight: for these LSB-first bit problems, two **anchor bit positions**
collapse the whole template+amount search:

- **At position 7**, every left-shift amount is dead, so the output column is a
  2-variable function of two input columns (the right-shift source and the
  rotate source).
- **At position 0**, every right-shift amount is dead, so the output column is a
  2-variable function of the left-shift and rotate sources.

So instead of guessing shift amounts by counting (which never worked as a
trainable trace), the reasoner reads the amounts off two **anchor tables** by
classifying the four quadrants of each anchor output column, joins the bit-7 and
bit-0 hypotheses on their shared rotate amount, and then runs a **full
verification line for every joint candidate** (failing at the first wrong bit).
Every line is either a direct candidate check or a scan-classification of
columns printed just above it — no best-of-many scores anywhere.

A trimmed slice of a real `p=7` anchor table (cell streams truncated with `…`):

```text
P7:
03  01:1 00:1 01:1 11:1 …  ->  11-1   1011 ORNOT 30
04  00:1 01:1 00:1 11:1 …  ->  11-1   1011 ORNOT 40
05  00:1 00:1 01:1 11:1 …  ->  11-1   1011 ORNOT 50
```

Each row scans one source-column pair across the examples, prints each
`(bit_u bit_v):out_bit` cell, then reduces them to the four-quadrant pattern
over `00 01 10 11` (`-` = a quadrant the examples never hit). Here `11-1`
matches the `ORNOT` function `1011`, and the trailing digits pin the source
columns (e.g. `30` → cols 3,0) which convert directly to shift amounts. Every
value sits on the line, so there's nothing to compute out of view.

Results of the reasoner itself (gold generation, before training):

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| exact-match | **1593 / 1602 (99.4%)** |
| trace tokens (mean / p95 / max) | 4,148 / ~4,600 / 6,739 |

The 9 it misses are example underdetermined.

Getting this trainable took several format passes guided by the generation
viewer. The rules are actually look weirdly complex at first glance, but thats where iterating with a coding assistant to refine the traces helped.

### Other optimizations

- **equation_numeric_deduce** Candidate operations are tried in order of their **measured frequency in the original problems**, so the first consistent match is also the most probable one (e.g. signed subtraction is tried before absolute difference because it's far more common). 
- **equation_numeric_guess** The same logic measured frequency logic as equation_numeric_deduce, but it achieves about 39% solve rate, which I literally didn't even look at, just asked Claude to follow the trainability principles and it came up with the trace. As long as it achieves low rates of token divergence in evals, it works.

Code for generation of the traces are shared along with the dataset.

## Compute & data

- **~$120 total spend.** I trained on **Google Colab Pro** (pay as you go) G4 instances and **Kaggle weekly compute**  for RTX 6000
  Pro instance.
- **Training data:**
  - **9,500 curated/"original" problems** (the competition-provided set, all 9
    categories), and
  - **15,000 synthetic problems** generated by my reasoners (heaviest on bit-manipulation).
  - The final mix oversamples/subsamples per category, with some randomly repeated samples from both original and generated.

| category | original | generated | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bit_manipulation | 2,000 | 6,500 | 8,500 |
| cipher | 2,000 | 2,400 | 4,400 |
| cryptarithm_deduce | 150 | 1,400 | 1,550 |
| cryptarithm_guess | 50 | 200 | 250 |
| equation_numeric_deduce | 1,000 | 2,300 | 3,300 |
| equation_numeric_guess | 100 | 1,900 | 2,000 |
| gravity | 1,600 | 1,600 | 3,200 |
| numeral | 1,600 | 400 | 2,000 |
| unit_conversion | 1,600 | 900 | 2,500 |
| **total** | **10,100** | **17,600** | **27,700** |

Final training takes about **11 hours** to converge to 99% solve rate on bit manipulation, but training on the same dataset for 5 hours should still achieve 0.89 private LB score.

## Discarded solutions

- **Bit-manipulation "partial solve".** Before the full anchor solver, I had a partial-solve trace that infers the operands based on Huikang's per bit operation deductions, this was about 93% solve rate, but had trainability issues. Though using this alone was enough to achieve a gold.
- **Cryptarithm (full solve).** Unfortunately I didn't have time to look into this, briefly tried to solve it using a limited set of operators and modulo arithmetic, but it didn't train well enough.

## Closing thoughts

Congratulations to the winners and thanks again to NVIDIA and Kaggle, and to everyone who shared their work. This was a genuinely great competition. This was my first time committing again on Kaggle after 1.5 years, and safe to say the use of LLMs supercharged everything, looking forward to future challenges.
