# 4th Place - Stacking Ensemble using XGB only

Thanks Kaggle for this fun playground competition!  As my first playground competition, this experience has been incredibly valuable. I've learned numerous ML techniques from the generous Kaggle community members who shared their approaches.

# Final Submissions

-   **Best CV (0.3842 CV score)**: 50-model ensemble using XGB
    
-   **Best LB**: (0.38384 public score and 0.38454 private score)

# Ensemble Architecture

The winning approach was an ensemble with XGBoost only and it contained the following:

## **1. TabTransformer Models (3 total)**

-   2 TabTransformers with feature engineering
    
-   1 TabTransformer without feature engineering
