Hi Kagglers! I'm excited to share my solution that scored 31 points in the ARC Prize 2024 competition. Instead of using existing language models, I took a "from-scratch" approach with custom transformer architectures, leading to some interesting findings.

## 🔑 Key Approaches & Findings
1. **Active Inference**: Implemented based on insights from MindAI/Jack Cole's team (a game-changer when I was stuck at 4 points!)
2. **Reverse Augmentation**: Originally implemented as "consistency", later discovered to align with MindAI's approach
3. **Custom Positional Encoding**: Developed a specialized `grid_encoding` that outperforms traditional NLP positional encoding
4. **Architectural Experiments**:
   - Transformer Mask Hack (disabled in final submission due to performance impact)
   - Progressive Head (impact uncertain due to later-discovered bugs)
5. **Minimal Vocabulary**: Efficient 19-token representation

## 🛠️ Technical Details
### Environment
- Python 3.11.9
- PyTorch 2.2.1

### Repository Structure
The code is organized into two main components:
- `dev_folder`: Development and training code
- `submission_folder`: Final submission code

## 📊 Performance Journey
- **Initial Stage**: 30-40% accuracy on public evaluation set with ~4 points on private test
  (Note: This early version is not in the GitHub repo, which contains only the final submission)
- **Final Result**: 31 points achieved using ensemble approach

## 🤔 Open Questions for the Community
1. Could this transformer-based approach reach the top of the leaderboard with further optimization? (I joined in the final month and couldn't explore larger models)
2. Is the 85% grand prize threshold achievable with this architecture?
3. What are your thoughts on specialized transformers versus general language models for this task?
